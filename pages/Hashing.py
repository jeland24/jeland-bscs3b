        MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 and has been extensively used in various security applications, although its security has been compromised over the years due to vulnerabilities.
